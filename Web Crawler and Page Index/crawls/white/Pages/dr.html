In recent years there has been a great deal of attention in the software engineering community on the 
development of techniques and tools that provide support for the design and implementation of 
applications to be distributed across networks of workstations.  Some of this focus has been on support 
for initial development and configuration of applications.  Other research has focused on techniques to 
support these types of applications at run-time.  One novel aspect of this type of environment is that the 
number of available resources tends to grow and shrink over time and this aspect has caused increased 
interest in dynamic reconfiguration techniques that allow applications to adapt at runtime to their 
changing environment.
<P>
Dynamic reconfiguration techniques are interesting for other reasons as well.  Very few distributed 
applications are static in their structure – clients enter and leave the system, additional computational 
resources are needed at different loads on the software or at different times in the processing, and 
different mechanisms of interaction may be more appropriate depending on the current computational 
load.  The ability to change the structure of applications at runtime by adding and removing 
components and bindings and by changing the characteristics of the relationships has wide use.  My 
work in this area, funded by a NSF CAREER award, has focused both on software support for dynamic 
reconfiguration and on frameworks and static software analysis techniques for determining the validity 
of component-level adaptations in the context of dynamic reconfiguration.

 Iterative grid-based parallel applications consist of 
some number of identical processes, each executing on its own processor and responsible for 
performing a computation over some portion of the grid. The processes are interconnected so that each 
can exchange information with processes operating on adjacent portions of the grid. For this style of 
application to be efficient, there needs to be a single processor for each process.  There is a great deal of 
interest in running these types of applications on non-dedicated workstation clusters; however, this is 
difficult because the set of available workstations fluctuates over time.  Dynamic reconfiguration offers 
a potential solution because we move processes and can change the level of parallelism to mirror the 
size of the set of available processors.
<P>
There are many issues that need to be addressed to allow this type of adaptive behavior.  When the level 
of parallelism changes, the way the partitioning of the grid must be recomputed for the new number of 
processors and then the data needs to be moved to mirror this partition. The configuration needs to be 
modified as well so that each process can communicate with the process that is operating on adjacent 
portions of the grid.  Any new processes need to be started, given data and initialized.  Old processes 
that are leaving are removed once their data has been given to another process.
<P>
While the details of how data is partitioned and repartitioned is necessarily application specific, some 
aspects of the tasks are similar across different applications.  With Sanjeev Setia, I have been working 
on the development of a toolkit, DyRecT, for iterative grid-based parallel applications intended to run 
on non-dedicated workstation clusters.  The primary goal of this toolkit is to provide dynamic 
reconfiguration support for this type of application without requiring programmers to change the model 
used to implement the original (non dynamic) application.  This toolkit provides default behaviors that 
work for a large class of applications and a low-level set of routines that allow the details to be 
implemented directly if the default behavior is not adequate.  
<P>
One of the issues we are currently addressing development of a high-level mechanism for transparently 
integrating the required synchronization in synchronous applications.  Another interesting issue, 
discussed in section 3.2 is how to allow this type of application to reconfigure when inside function or 
procedure calls.  Allowing reconfiguration outside the main program means that we may have to deal 
with capturing and restoring activation record stack both to update variables associated with the change 
and to create runtime stacks for processes that are being added to the system.  This software has been 
under construction since late 1997 and is near completion.  A number of Ph.D. and Masters students 
have been involved with this implementation effort.

<li><B> Analysis of Component Adaptation</b> [5][6]
<P>

 One aspect of dynamic reconfiguration that has received little 
attention is the participation that is required of the individual components when a dynamic 
reconfiguration change is needed.  Component participation can include divulging information to the 
runtime system, using information from the system to change internal state, to change the algorithms 
use, or to initialize state if a new process.  The details for a given component and reconfiguration are 
necessarily application and change specific.  
<P>
We differentiate dynamic reconfiguration, a change to the application structure, from adaptation, a 
change done to a component to accommodate the needed reconfiguration.  These adaptation changes 
are orthogonal to the computations done as part of the application; however, if done incorrectly can 
mean that the application no longer works once a reconfiguration is done.  A simple example is a 
component of a parallel application that is adaptive using techniques described in the previous section.  
When the level of parallelism changes at runtime, the individual components are going to operate on a 
different size data set.  In addition to updating the internal grid of a component , program variables that 
are tied to the size of the data set must be changed to reflect this new size.  If this change is done 
incompletely, a application will no longer work after a dynamic reconfiguration.
<P>
The goal of this research is to use static program analysis techniques to detect situations such as this.  
The user of the analysis tools are responsible for informing the tools where in the source code 
adaptations can take place and what changes to the state will be made when an adaptation is needed.  
Returning to the grid-based parallel program example, changes to the grid as well as to the variables 
associated with the starting and ending row number will be made.  The points at which this could 
potentially happen are marked.  
<P>
Our analysis technique is based on a new technique for partitioning the program variables into three 
sets: adaptable variables which are changed with an adaptation, conserved variables which are 
completely independent of the adaptation, and inconsistant variables, variables with characteristics of 
both adaptable and conserved.  I use static backwards slicing to find the subset of the program on which 
the value of each live variable depends.  This subset is examined to do the final classification.  
Adaptable and conserved variables are provably consistent after a runtime adaptation. Inconsistent 
variables must be evaluated by the programmer to determine if a problem will result at runtime.  The 
analysis we do is limited to static program variables and static variables on the runtime stack.
<P>
I started working on these ideas during the summer of 1998 and have a prototype tool built that 
performs the analysis described above and performs some source to source transformation to deal with 
adaptive variables on the runtime activation record stack.
